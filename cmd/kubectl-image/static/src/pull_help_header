Pulls an image from a remote imgctrl instance

This command requests a remote imgctrl instance to forward us a certain image.
Shipwright image operator creates a blob with the image and, on receiving, we
copy it's content into local storage.

This subcommand communicates directly with a imgctrl instance through GRPC.
Once imgctrl is exposed you can pull images using imgctrl address as a registry
name.

In order to pull images from a Kubernetes cluster you need to be authenticated
using a token.
